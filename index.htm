<!-- Important commands: 
git add intex.htm
git status
git commit (opens vi editor)
In vi editor:
Initial commit
to exit vi:
press Esc
:wq
git status
git checkout: restores the old file which was not committed


For creating blank files:
touch about.htm
touch contact.htm
touch .gitignore: Ignores and and dont commits or shows this file to the 
                   other colaborator (peronal files can be kept here)


for adding all the available files to track: 
git add -A

Note: After modifying a file we need to add and then commit

git checkout filename: ignores the  recent commit made and gives the actual file before one commit
git checkout -f: for all the files

git log:
gives all the commits and info

git log -a -number of changes
ex: git log -a -1
-->

<!-- git diff: gives the changes/difference between the non added(new/modified) file 
    and added file(old/non-modified/staged) -->

<!-- git commit -a -m "Some Text" -->


<!-- git branch filename: creates another branch next to master so that if we need to 
                      add some features. Also to note that when we give this command 
                      the contents of master branch will be copied to the other brach so 
                      we can safely work on it to change some things
git branch: lists the available branches along with master -->
<!-- git checkout master(branchname): to switch between different branches -->
<!-- git merge branchname: running this while in master branch will merge the contents of
                        the other branch with the master -->
<!-- Sample text to see if it merges or overwrites the contets in the master after using 
        merge command  -->
